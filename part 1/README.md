## Introduction

### Document Purpose

This technical documentation presents the complete architecture and design of the HBnB (Holberton Airbnb Clone) system. It serves as a detailed reference to guide implementation phases and provides a clear overview of the system architecture.

### Project Overview

HBnB is a property rental application that allows users to:
- Search and book accommodations
- List their own properties
- Leave and view reviews
- Manage their profiles and bookings

### Documentation Scope

This documentation covers:
- The system's layered architecture
- Data models and their relationships
- Component interaction flows
- Design patterns used

---

## High-Level Architecture

### Architectural Pattern: 3-Layer Architecture

The HBnB system adopts a layered architecture that separates responsibilities into three distinct levels:

1. **Presentation Layer**: User interface and API management
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Application logic and business rules
3. **Persistence Layer**: Data management and database access

### High-Level Package Diagram

```mermaid

    subgraph PL["Presentation Layer"]
        API[API Services]
        UI[User Interface]
    end
    subgraph BL["Business Logic Layer"]
        Facade[Facade Pattern]
        Models[Business Models]
        Services[Business Services]
    end
    subgraph DL["Persistence Layer"]
        Repo[Repositories]
        DB[Database]
    end
    API --> Facade
    UI --> Facade
    Facade --> Models
    Facade --> Services
    Models --> Repo
    Services --> Repo
    Repo --> DB
```
**Insert here the package diagram showing:**
- The three main layers
- The Facade pattern for inter-layer communication
- Key components of each layer

### Facade Pattern

The Facade pattern is used to:
- Simplify interactions between layers
- Provide a unified interface
- Reduce coupling between components
- Facilitate maintenance and system evolution

## Business Logic Layer

### Overview

The business logic layer contains the main domain entities and their interactions. It implements business rules and orchestrates data operations.

### Detailed Class Diagram

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class BaseModel {
    + UUID id
    + DateTime created_at
    + DateTime updated_at
    + save()
    + delete()
  }

  class User {
    + string first_name
    + string last_name
    + string email
    + string password
    + boolean is_admin
    + login()
    + logout()
    + validate()
  }

  class Place {
    + string name
    + string description
    + float price
    + string address
    + int max_guests
    + UUID owner_id
    + publish()
    + search()
  }

  class Review {
    + UUID user_id
    + UUID place_id
    + int rating
    + string text
    + boolean verified
    + moderate()
  }

  class Amenity {
    + string name
    + string type
    + activate()
    + deactivate()
  }

  BaseModel <|-- User
  BaseModel <|-- Place
  BaseModel <|-- Review
  BaseModel <|-- Amenity

  User "1" --> "0..*" Place : owns
  User "1" --> "0..*" Review : creates  
  Place "1" --> "0..*" Review : receives
  Place "0..*" --> "0..*" Amenity : includes
```

### Main Entities

#### BaseModel
- **Responsibility**: Abstract class providing common attributes and methods
- **Key Attributes**: Unique identifier, creation/modification timestamps
- **Common Methods**: Entity saving and deletion

#### User
- **Responsibility**: Represents system users
- **Features**: Authentication, profile management, administrative rights
- **Relations**: Owns properties, creates reviews

#### Place
- **Responsibility**: Represents properties available for rental
- **Features**: Publishing, searching, information management
- **Relations**: Belongs to a user, receives reviews, includes amenities

#### Review
- **Responsibility**: Manages property reviews and ratings
- **Features**: Rating, moderation, verification
- **Relations**: Linked to a user and a property

#### Amenity
- **Responsibility**: Represents property amenities and services
- **Features**: Categorization, activation/deactivation
- **Relations**: Associated with multiple properties

### Design Decisions

- **Inheritance**: Use of BaseModel class to factorize common code
- **Relations**: Modeling of business associations between entities
- **Encapsulation**: Business methods encapsulated within each class
- **Extensibility**: Structure allowing easy addition of new entities

## API Interaction Flow

### Overview

The following sequence diagrams illustrate interactions between different layers during main API calls.

### 1. Place Search

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant API
    participant BusinessLogic
    participant Database

    User->>API: GET /places?city_id=xyz&max_price=100
    API->>BusinessLogic: process_search_query()
    BusinessLogic->>Database: SELECT * FROM places WHERE criteria
    Database-->>BusinessLogic: return list of places
    BusinessLogic-->>API: send filtered list
    API-->>User: 200 OK + JSON list
```

**Flow Description:**
- User performs a search with specific criteria
- API validates and forwards the request to business layer
- Business logic builds and executes database query
- Results are filtered and formatted before being returned

### 2. Place Creation

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant API
    participant BusinessLogic
    participant Database

    User->>API: POST /places (place data)
    API->>BusinessLogic: validate_place_data()
    BusinessLogic->>Database: INSERT new place
    Database-->>BusinessLogic: confirmation
    BusinessLogic-->>API: return success response
    API-->>User: 201 Created / Error
```

**Flow Description:**
- User submits new property data
- Data validation by business layer
- Database insertion if validation succeeds
- Confirmation or error returned to user

### 3. Review Creation

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant API
    participant BusinessLogic
    participant Database

    User->>API: POST /places/<id>/reviews (review data)
    API->>BusinessLogic: validate_review_data()
    BusinessLogic->>Database: INSERT new review
    Database-->>BusinessLogic: confirmation
    BusinessLogic-->>API: return success response
    API-->>User: 201 Created / Error
```

**Flow Description:**
- Review submission for a specific property
- Validation including rights verification and consistency
- Database recording with error handling
- Result notification to user

### 4. User Registration

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant API
    participant BusinessLogic
    participant Database

    User->>API: POST /users (registration data)
    API->>BusinessLogic: validate_user_data()
    BusinessLogic->>Database: INSERT new user
    Database-->>BusinessLogic: confirmation
    BusinessLogic-->>API: return success response
    API-->>User: 201 Created / Error
```

**Flow Description:**
- New registration with personal data
- Complete validation including email uniqueness
- Password hashing before storage
- Account creation with error handling

### Common Interaction Patterns

#### Error Management
- Systematic input data validation
- Structured error propagation between layers
- Appropriate HTTP status codes

#### Security
- Authorization validation at each level
- User data sanitization
- Secure password hashing

#### Performance
- Optimized queries according to business needs
- Efficient database transaction management
- Frequently used data caching
